require 'paint' # rainbow was okay but man paint is glorious with true color support - need to run on iTerm2 though VSCode doesn't have true color support and strangely the pawn unicode doesn't work great on iTerm2 is some other hyperrealistic pawn will need to change it up lol weird the black pawn just doesn't work the white one does it's too hollow sadly but better than nothing guess it'll do for now
